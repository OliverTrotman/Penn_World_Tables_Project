# Penn_World_Tables_Project
The Penn World Tables provide nation-level data for important economic characteristics of a country. For example, metrics to measure health, education, economic performance and infrastructure levels. I replaced the paper by Francesco Caselli (2003) which uses 1995 PWT data to explain country development and updated it with data from 2019.
